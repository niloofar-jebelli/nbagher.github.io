Course Description: CDS-130 satisfies the Mason Core educational requirement for “IT with
Ethics”. CDS-130 teaches the fundamentals of data representation, image processing, and
computational modeling, and also introduces students to important topics in computational
mathematics. MATLAB® is our computing framework.

Expected Educational Outcome: This class is part of the Mason Core, specifically, it meets the
Information Technology and Computing requirements. Information technology and computing
can significantly augment humans' ability to produce, consume, process, and communicate
information. Thus, students need to understand ways to use such technology to enhance their
lives, careers, and society, while being mindful of challenges such as security, source reliability,
automation, and ethical implications. These factors have made it essential for students to
understand how to effectively navigate the evolving technological landscape. IT courses offered
in the majors may focus on disciplinary applications and concerns of information technology.
IT courses meet the following learning outcomes:
1. Students will understand the principles of information storage, exchange, security, and
privacy and be aware of related ethical issues.
2. Students will become critical consumers of digital information; they will be capable of
selecting and evaluating appropriate, relevant, and trustworthy sources of information.
3. Students can use appropriate information and computing technologies to organize and
analyze information and use it to guide decision-making.
4. Students will be able to choose and apply appropriate algorithmic methods to solve a
problem.
Students will learn to think computationally about the world around them. This is novel for most
students, and thus, will require thought and work. Students will learn to construct computational
models of natural phenomena using MATLAB.

Preliminary Advice: I strongly recommended that you stay on top of the workload for this
course and make every attempt to attend all lectures! The past experience is that CDS-130
homework becomes very highly demanding for students who miss class, or who choose not to
invest time in their assigned homework—or both. That’s because most if not all lecture topics
(including MATLAB) will likely be new for almost everyone. Furthermore, lecture topics are
cumulative. So please don’t miss class if you can help it. Also, it helps to begin homework early,
and to engage regularly with our course assistants. Please remember: If you have questions at any
time, please ask—never, ever hesitate to ask questions!

Computer Software Use: MATLAB. MATLAB can be accessed from locations on campus.
MATLAB can also be accessed via GMU’s Virtual Computing Laboratory (VCL). The VCL
provides students MATLAB access from their Mac or PC laptop computer on campus or at home.
See the presentation in the MATLAB class folder for instructions on how to access the VCL.
MATLAB is available on GMU network workstations in the Johnson Center, in Innovation Hall,
and in some residence halls. Alternatively, GMU students may purchase MATLAB directly from
Mathworks (the MATLAB Student Unbundled version costs $49). There is also a web-based, free
compatible alternative with some limitations called Octave (https://octave-online.net).
