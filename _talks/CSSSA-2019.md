Cities are complex systems which are constantly changing because of the interactions between the
people and their environment. Such systems often go through several life cycles which are shaped by
various processes. These may include urban growth, sprawl, shrinkage, and gentrification. These
processes affect the urban land markets which in turn affect the formation of a city through feedback
loops. Through models we can explore such dynamics, populations, and the environments in which
people inhabit. The model proposed in this paper intends to simulate the aforementioned dynamics
to capture the effect of agentsâ€™ choices and actions on the city structure. Specifically, this model
explores the effect of gentrification on population density and housing values. The proposed model is
significant in its integration of ideas from complex systems theory which is operationalized within an
agent-based model stylized on urban theories to study gentrification as a cause of increased in land
values. The model is stylized on urban theories and results from the model show that the agents move
to and reside in properties within their income range, neighboring agents that have similar economic
status. The model also shows the role of gentrification by capturing both the supply and demand
aspects of this process in the displacement and immobilization of agents with lower incomes. This
is one of the first models that combines several processes to explore the life cycle of a city through
agent-based modeling.
