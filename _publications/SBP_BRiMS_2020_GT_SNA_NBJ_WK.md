For years, we believed that the transition of human communities from simple hunter-gatherer societies to complex sedentary societies occurred due to the expansion of cultivation and the rise of agriculture. Gobekli Tepe, a pre-pottery Neolithic site in Turkey, presents a new explanation that can shed light on the human development to civilization. This archaeological site was constructed through the collaboration of various hunter-gatherer societies as a communal space for ritualistic purposes. Studies show a similarity in architecture, tools, crops and symbolism of some of Gobekli Tepe's neighboring cultures. The commonalities suggest the existence of a shared belief before the construction of the site. Utilizing agent-based modeling and social network analysis tools, this paper investigates the belief propagation to observe the emergence of leaders among the population and examines the network structure of the communities constructing Gobekli Tepe. Most importantly, this site represents a complex adaptive system where the interactions of its components may have caused the emergence of a belief institution.
