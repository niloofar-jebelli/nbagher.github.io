I am a PhD candidate in the [Computational Social Science Program](https://science.gmu.edu/academics/departments-units/computational-data-sciences/computational-social-science-phd) at George Mason Universityâ€™s [Department of Computational and Data Sciences](https://science.gmu.edu/academics/departments-units/computational-data-sciences) and an instructor teaching Computing for Scientists within the department. I obtained my Bachelors of Arts in [Anthropology](https://anth.umd.edu/) along with a minor in [Middle Eastern Studies](http://history.umd.edu/undergraduate/programs/middleeast) from University of Maryland, College Park and my Masters of [Interdisciplinary Studies](https://mais.gmu.edu/programs/la-mais-isin-css) with a concentration on Computational Social Science from George Mason University.

My previous projects included utilizing agent-based modeling to develop an urban environment and the analyze the interactions of gentrification, urban growth, urban sprawl, and urban shrinkage; as well as building a cognitive model of a citizen deciding what to believe when encountering election stories on social media, eventually developing an opinion and using motivated reasoning to help determine which stories are true. Currently, I am working on the emergence of social complexity at Gobekli Tepe in the Neolithic era utilizing agent-based modeling, social network analysis, and multi-agent reinforcement learning methods. My PhD dissertation committee members are [Dr. William Kennedy](http://www.mllab.com/), [Dr. Andrew Crooks](https://www.gisagents.org/p/about-gis-and-agent-based-modeling.html), [Dr. Robert Axtell](http://css1.gmu.edu/~axtell/Rob/Home.html), and [Dr. Daniel Rogers](https://profiles.si.edu/display/nRogersd6202005).

I am very interested in the intersection of cultural anthropology, social psychology and computational modeling. My topics of interest are social complexity, group identity, social cohesion, culture change, information diffusion, and narrative formations. I generally employ agent-based modeling, social network analysis, cognitive modeling, and machine learning methods in my research.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
